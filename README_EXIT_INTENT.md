## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

Open `app/layout.tsx` and change:

```tsx
<ExitIntentPopup 
  whatsappNumber="919876543210"  // ← Your WhatsApp number
  whatsappMessage="Hi, mujhe website development ke baare mein details chahiye"
/>
```

### Step 2: Test Locally
```bash
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

### Step 3: Test Popup
**Mobile:** Open DevTools (F12) → Toggle device toolbar (Ctrl+Shift+M) → Wait 25 sec or scroll

**Desktop:** Move mouse to very top of page (near browser tabs)

---

## 📱 How It Works

### Mobile (≤ 768px width)
Shows **bottom sheet** popup with 4 triggers:

```
┌─ After 25 seconds
├─ After scrolling 60% down  → Any ONE of these triggers
├─ After 10 seconds inactive │    shows bottom sheet
└─ Back button press        ┘

User sees:
┌──────────────────────────┐
│ Website banwani hai?     │
│ Free demo WhatsApp par   │
│ [Chat on WhatsApp] 🟢    │
│ [Maybe Later]            │
└──────────────────────────┘
```

### Desktop (> 768px width)
Shows **centered modal** when:

```
Mouse moves to top (browser close area)

User sees:
┌──────────────────────────┐
│ Wait! Website banwani?   │
│ ✓ Free consultation      │
│ ✓ Custom design          │
│ ✓ Fast turnaround        │
│ [Chat on WhatsApp] 🟢    │
│ [Maybe Later]            │
└──────────────────────────┘
```

## ⚙️ Key Settings to Adjust

### In `components/sections/ExitIntentPopup.tsx`:

| Setting | Current | File | Line | What to Change |
|---------|---------|------|------|---|
| Time delay | 25 sec | ExitIntentPopup.tsx | 124 | `25000` → change value |
| Scroll % | 60% | ExitIntentPopup.tsx | 149 | `> 60` → change number |
| Inactivity | 10 sec | ExitIntentPopup.tsx | 178 | `10000` → change value |
| Mouse exit | 10px | ExitIntentPopup.tsx | 107 | `< 10` → change number |

### In `app/layout.tsx`:

```tsx
whatsappNumber="919876543210"  // Change phone
whatsappMessage="Your message"  // Change text
```

---

## 🎨 Easy Customizations

### Change Color (Green → Blue)
Find this in `ExitIntentPopup.tsx`:
```tsx
className="bg-gradient-to-r from-green-500 to-green-600"
```

Change to:
```tsx
className="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-blue-600"
```

### Change Heading Text
**Mobile:**
```tsx
<h2>Website banwani hai?</h2>  // Change this
```

**Desktop:**
```tsx
<h2>Wait! Website banwani hai?</h2>  // Or this
```

### Disable a Trigger
Comment out the entire `useEffect` for the trigger you want to disable (e.g., scroll trigger).

## 🔧 Advanced Customizations

### Recommended Settings by Use Case

#### For E-commerce:
```javascript
Time: 30 sec
Scroll: 50%
Inactivity: 15 sec
Message: "Limited time - 20% off today"
```

#### For SaaS:
```javascript
Time: 40 sec
Scroll: 70%
Inactivity: 20 sec
Message: "Free demo - Book your call"
```

#### For Consulting/Services:
```javascript
Time: 20 sec (aggressive)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Popup not showing?
1. Clear browser cache: Ctrl+Shift+Delete
2. Clear sessionStorage:
   ```javascript
   sessionStorage.clear()
   location.reload()
   ```
3. Check console for errors (F12 → Console)

### Showing too many times?
- Check sessionStorage is working
- Increase time delay (make less aggressive)

### WhatsApp not opening?
- Verify phone number format: `country_code + number`
- Test format: `919876543210` (India example)

### Animation not smooth?
- Ensure Tailwind CSS is configured
- Check browser console for warnings

Monthly: 42 × 30 = 1,260 customers
Average value: $500 = $630,000 revenue/month
